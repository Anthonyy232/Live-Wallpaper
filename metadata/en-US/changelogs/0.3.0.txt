v0.3.0
Added app icon and GitHub redirect in settings page

Planning
Look into whether live wallpaper using WallpaperManager (WallpaperManager.ACTION_LIVE_WALLPAPER_CHOOSER) would work well/be realistic
It would drain too much battery. Video/GIF wallpaper is also not possible with current WallpaperManager APIs without using live wallpaper
